A Firefox extensions to hide and show the bookmarks toolbar.

# Features #
You can set _Hide BookmarksBar_ to automatically show the toolbar when you hover the toolbar. You can change this behavior to only show the toolbar when you hover the toolbar button (It works both with the extension's button and Firefox's built-in bookmarks button).
Alternatively, you can toggle the toolbar manually with the toolbar button or a hotkey. In this case, you can additionally tell _Hide BookmarksBar_ whether to show toolbar when opening a new window. It can also help you by showing the toolbar when a new tab is opened and hiding it when a page is opened.
This last feature works a bit like Google Chrome, where the toolbar is visibile on the 'new tab' page. The difference is that with _Hide BookmarksBar_, the toolbar is not a part of the _new tab_ page, but displayed whenever you visit `about:blank` (which is the default for a new tab) or your homepage.
